## Hosam Hamdy Mohammad (IPA: /ħʊsæːm ˈħæːmdiː mʊˈħæmmæd/)

I'm a full stack web developer with endless passion for innovation, sympathy, inclusion, harmony, and clarity.

I have a special care for good, sympathetic design, attention to details, and "enough".

I love roots, origins, factories, and birth.
